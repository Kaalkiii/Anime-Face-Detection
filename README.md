Anime Face Detection

AnimeFaceDetection is a deep learning-based project that detects anime faces in images using modern computer vision techniques. It leverages pre-trained models and deep learning frameworks to accurately identify and localize anime-style faces.

Features

Accurate Face Detection: Uses state-of-the-art deep learning models to detect anime faces.

Lightweight & Fast: Optimized for quick inference without heavy computational requirements.

Easy Integration: Can be integrated into various applications like AI art platforms, anime character recognition systems, and more.

Supports Multiple Formats: Works with images of different formats such as JPG, PNG, etc.

Installation

# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/AnimeFaceDetection.git
cd AnimeFaceDetection

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage

from anime_face_detector import AnimeFaceDetector

detector = AnimeFaceDetector()
faces = detector.detect("path_to_image.jpg")

# Visualize results
detector.show_faces("path_to_image.jpg", faces)

Model

This project utilizes a pre-trained deep learning model, such as:

YOLO-based model trained on anime datasets.

MTCNN for multi-stage face detection.
