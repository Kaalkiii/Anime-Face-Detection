# Anime Face Detection

AnimeFaceDetection is a deep learning-powered project designed to detect anime-style faces in images using advanced computer vision techniques. It employs pre-trained models and deep learning frameworks to provide high-accuracy facial recognition.

## Features

- **High-Accuracy Detection**: Utilizes state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms for precise anime face detection.
- **Optimized Performance**: Fast and lightweight model for efficient processing.
- **Seamless Integration**: Easily incorporable into AI art tools, anime character identification systems, and other applications.
- **Multi-Format Support**: Compatible with various image formats including JPG, PNG, and more.

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/AnimeFaceDetection.git
cd AnimeFaceDetection

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

```python
from anime_face_detector import AnimeFaceDetector

detector = AnimeFaceDetector()
faces = detector.detect("path_to_image.jpg")

# Display results
detector.show_faces("path_to_image.jpg", faces)
```

## Model

AnimeFaceDetection utilizes deep learning models, including:

- **YOLO-based models** trained specifically for anime datasets.
- **MTCNN (Multi-task Cascaded Convolutional Networks)** for precise face detection.
